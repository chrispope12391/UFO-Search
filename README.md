# javascript-challenge

Create a web page using JavaScript, HTML and CSS that uses input filters to allow the user to view a generated HTML table using differing filter inputs.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository and title it as you please. I have given mine the title, javascript-challenge.

1. Clone the new repository to your computer.

1. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the individual challenges: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.

1. Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

1. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Summary

### UFO-Level-1

For the first level, we created a webpage that allows you to filter the HTML table by date and appends the filtered results to the webpage.

* Using the UFO dataset attached in our repository that is currently in the form of an array of JavaScript object, write code that appends the table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    
    * Make sure that the web page has columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

The resulting web page should resemble this:
